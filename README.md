# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
A python Tic-Tac-Toe project which incorporates three difficulty levels of opposing AI.
Easy level difficulty makes moves based upon randomness.
Medium level difficulty makes moves based upon a quality algorithm but is not fullproof.
Hard level difficulty makes moves based upon a powerful minimax algorithm where every possible move and subsequent position is evaluated and the best move is chosen. This algorithm involves a scoring system to rank each move and a cache to significantly improve processing speeds.
